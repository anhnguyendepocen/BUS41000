# Generate 5000 worlds, each simulate 20 years
returns = matrix(rnorm(n = 5000*20, mean = 6, sd = 15), 
                 nrow = 5000, ncol=20)/100
total_wealth = apply(1+returns, 1, prod)

```r
# Plotting
d = density(total_wealth)
plot(d, xlab="total wealth in $", ylab = "density",
      main = "Total wealth in 20 years", xlim = c(0,20))
abline(v = mean(total_wealth), col = 'red', lty=2)
abline(v = median(total_wealth), col = 'blue', lty=2)
legend("topright", 
  legend = c(paste("mean ", round(mean(total_wealth),2)), 
        paste("median ", round(median(total_wealth),2))), 
       col = c('red', 'blue'), lty = c(2,2))
